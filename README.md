# OS Coursework Journal - CMPN202 Operating Systems

**Student:** Tapendra Budha (A00031464)  
**Module:** CMPN202 Operating Systems, University of Roehampton  
**Assessment:** Technical Journal (50%) documenting 7 weeks of Linux server configuration, security, and performance evaluation.  
**GitHub Pages Site:** [View Journal](https://github.com/Tapendra96/os-coursework-journal/)  
**Date Completed:** January 06, 2026  

## Overview
This repository hosts my technical journal for the Operating Systems coursework. It documents the setup of a headless Ubuntu Server VM accessed via SSH from a Kali Workstation VM in VirtualBox. All administration is CLI-based, focusing on security (e.g., SSH keys, firewall, AppArmor), performance testing (e.g., stress, iperf3), and audits (e.g., Lynis, nmap). The journal includes screenshots, code, reflections, and links to learning outcomes (LO3, LO4, LO5).

Key Features:
- Weekly Markdown files with embedded images and code snippets.
- System specs, scripts, and quantitative data (e.g., performance metrics, audit scores).
- Reflections on trade-offs (e.g., security vs. performance).
- Ethical: Isolated VM network, no real-world testing.
